We know that according to Pythagoras' theorem, if we have two sides of a right-angled triangle, calculate the value of the third side using the equation below.
```
c**2 = a**2 + b**2
```
Naming the sides of a right triangle in the program is like the picture above.

### notes
1.Please design this program in different languages and put it in this repository. Please put your code in ```src``` folder  and then in a folder named that language.
